                <p class="paragraph">
                    You might feel like you’re stuck in a rut in your daily life. Or you’re yearning for something
                    exciting and different. You’re craving new experiences and new challenges. Travel is the ideal place
                    to test yourself. It pushes people to their limits and gets them outside their comfort zone. You’ll
                    discover how resourceful you are when you’re exposed to new places, people and experiences. Maybe
                    it’s finding your way around a busy city. Or ordering a meal when you don’t speak the language. Or
                    zip-lining. You’ll feel pride when you finish your trip successfully. Overcoming challenges will
                    bring you joy and energy for future tests. You’ll realize how capable you are and build your
                    confidence.

                <h3 class="subtitle">Getting in touch with yourself</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Getting away from home gives you the opportunity to reflect on your life. You have the needed time
                    and space to let your mind wander and take stock. Traveling is one of the best ways to learn more
                    about yourself. Every day traveling brings a new set of issues and opportunities. The way you handle
                    those also gives you insight into who you are. You’ll come home knowing yourself better, and with a
                    fresh perspective on what you want out of life. The experience will change your life.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Learning is a strong reason why people love to travel. They want to experience something unfamiliar
                    and leave with new skills or knowledge. Seeing the world is more educational than a high school or
                    college class. This condensed crash course in discovering how the rest of the world lives actually
                    will cover subjects like history, geography and sociology. Every destination has something unique to
                    teach visitors, and immersing themselves in a completely different world is the best learning
                    experience.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    People may travel to learn something specific: a new language, a new cuisine, aspects of a different
                    culture, or a deeper appreciation of faith or spirituality. As a bonus, they’ll take away more than
                    their specific goal. They’ll discover totally different ways of doing things. They’ll also gain
                    awareness of new customs, cultures, people and places. And because you’re actually experiencing this
                    learning in real life, not reading it in a textbook, it will stay with you for a long time. You’ll
                    gain a deep sense of satisfaction with the new skills you’ve learned – and new insights you’ve
                    gained.
